<span class="grey">\"On my honour, I swear eternal love and allegiance to the Rose, the King, and to the Four Virtues of Lady Ioriel."\n-Final verse of the Lorentish Knight's Vow</span>\n\n<span class="orange">Primer</span>\nLorent has sat as the rightful sovereign of Western Cannor (known as <span class="yellow">Lencenor</span>) since long before the arrival of the elves in 1000 AA.\nIt is a country famed for its etiquette, bountiful vineyards and romantic tales of chivalry, but also as one of the <span class="yellow">Great Powers of Cannor</span>, competing with <span class="yellow">Gawed</span> to the north and the <span class="yellow">Empire of Anbennar</span> to the east for dominion over the continent of <span class="yellow">Cannor</span>.\n\nThe kingdom owes its inception and name to <span class="yellow">Lorenan the Great</span>, an ancient human king who famously defeated the invading <span class="yellow">Alenic</span> ancestors of its now-rival <span class="yellow">Gawed</span> during the chaos of the <span class="yellow">Dragonwake</span> in 470. In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf <span class="yellow">Ioriel</span> in 1022, the wife of then King <span class="yellow">Ruben II</span>, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: <span class="yellow">High Lorentish</span> (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the <span class="yellow">Low Lorentish</span> (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the <span class="yellow">Redfoot Halflings</span> of the southern <span class="yellow">Small Country</span>, and maintains close relations with its ancient <span class="yellow">Ruby Dwarf</span> neighbours of <span class="yellow">Rubyhold</span>. The <span class="yellow">Elfrealm</span> of the <span class="yellow">Redglades</span> also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n<span class="orange">Recent History</span>\nThe <span class="yellow">Lilac Wars</span> (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the <span class="yellow">House of Silmuna</span> and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, <span class="yellow">Kylian VI</span> now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the <span class="yellow">Wine Lords</span> of <span class="yellow">Madelaire, Eil√≠sin,</span> and <span class="yellow">Rubenaire</span>, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, <span class="yellow">Lothane, the Grand Duke of Wex</span>, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling <span class="yellow">Small Country</span> remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, <span class="yellow">Gawed</span>. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of <span class="yellow">Lorenan the Great</span>.
